<div id="search-component">
  <h4>Hero Search</h4>
  <input #searchBox id="search-box" (keyup)="search(searchBox.value)" />
  <div>
    <!--
The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.
The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async, which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe.
The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class.

    <div *ngFor="let hero of heroes$ | async" (click)="gotoDetail(hero)" class="search-result">
      {{hero.name}}
    </div>
